# Responsive-Portfolio
1. Got the navbar working on the homepage. Then moved on to the portfolio and contact pages to get the navbar working there.
2. Added an image on the home page.
3. Spent a while trying to get the body test to wrap around the image on the homepage.
4. Added github and linkedin image links to the bottom of the homepage. Couldn't get them the same size. Also couldn't figure out how to center them on the page, and have them on the same level.
5. Added a form to the contact page.
6. Added placeholder images on the portfolio page. I was not sure what these images were supposed to be, so I made them links to 2 different repositories on my github. I would have linked more, and I can in the future, but at the moment those are the only two real projects (not examples) on my github. 
7. Cannot get portfolio page pictures to display 2 across on smaller screens, I though "col-xs-6" should do this
7. Updated my bio to be accurate info+lorem ipsum.
